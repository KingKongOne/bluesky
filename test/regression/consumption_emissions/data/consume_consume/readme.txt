The output files were created using Consume5 and the "natural" option like so:

Brians-MacBook-Pro:apps-consumeGIT briandrye$ python consume_batch.py -l 3 -o ~/repos/uw/bluesky/bluesky/test/regression/consumption_emissions/data/consume5_regression/scen_1_out.csv natural ~/repos/uw/bluesky/bluesky/test/regression/consumption_emissions/data/consume5_regression/scen_1.csv
